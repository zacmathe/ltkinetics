# ltkinetics

Python code for simulating the kinetics of the nitrogenase enzyme system,
following the work of Thorneley and Lowe. 

## How?
The ODEs were adapted from 

## Why?
I do not know of any readily usable, publically available code for simulating nitrogenase kinetics. The doctoral thesis of Phillip E. Wilson (1) includes Mathematica code, but it is not copy-pasteable and Mathematica is closed-source. 

### Disclaimer
This is a work-in-progress by a non-programmer.
